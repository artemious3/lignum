Cluster, generated by a couple, is a set of
      - all direct descendants of this couple
      - partners of direct ancestors, if they have no parents specified
      - all direct ancestors that are put first in the couple.
      - ancesors, put second in couple, and their children:
                    only if their children are the only descendants specified.


2 modes of rendering influence building the clusters.

1. Extended rendering.

   If some condition, specified in cluster definition does not hold for a couple or person,
   they generate new cluster.

1. Compact

   All persons are assumed to hold the condition. That is, parents of partners of descendants are ignored
   and descendants of partners of ancestors (other than children) are ignored.
