# Lignum - all you need for your family tree

Lignum is a minimal and sufficient tool you need for building full and informative family tree graphs.

Unlike other genealogy software, Lignum is:

 - focused on ONE task : building and rendering family tree graphs;

 - very easy to use : has just enough functions and no more than that;

 - cross-platform : available for any platform Qt can host


## Usage

After opening Lignum, you will see your first family tree, consisting of two people. 
Select a person with left-click. You can add relatives using the following keys:

 - `M` - add mother
 
 - `F` - add father
 
 - `P` - add partner
 
 - `S` - add son
 
 - `D` - add daughter
 
 - `R` - remove person, if possible
 
 - `G` - change gender


You can save, export or import family tree using menu bar. 

That's all.
